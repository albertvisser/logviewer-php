# logviewer-php
check server logs

The original a PHP version of an attempt to build a quick and dirty something
to read my server logs from within my web browser,
Later rebuilt in Python using various web frameworks.

The adapted version uses Sqlite for storing its settings
and caching the currently selected logfile.

(I'm not sure if this version actually works as I switched to Python while I was making it.
Also I added this here just to keep it somewhere... it was actually built in 2012)
